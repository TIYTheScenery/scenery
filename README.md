# The Scenery

The Scenery aims to support the performing arts industry by providing resources for patrons of the arts and artists alike.. You can find out about your local performance scene whether you’re a patron looking for fresh entertainment, an actor looking for an audition, or a company looking to promote their work.

The Scenery utilizes some of the latest web technologies to bring live performance to you! Built with HTML5 and CSS3, using an Angular.js and Jquery front end supported by Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL database serving up our API. The-Scenery.com is served to all your devices by Heroku and Firebase servers wrapped in one domain with Amazon Web Services providing additional file storage for the images.

The Scenery allows everyone to have the performing arts at their fingertips. Bertolt Brecht once said, “The play isn’t finished until people are in the streets talking about it.” The street corner is now digital, and its bustling live at www.the-scenery.com.
